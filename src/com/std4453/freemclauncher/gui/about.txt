Introduction

I don't know whether it is good to write such a article in what sounds like
an usage. But I think that I should explain why I came to the idea of building
this Minecraft launcher.
So just a few years earlier, I got to know a very interesting and famous game
called Minecraft, and got attracted by it very shortly afterwards. As anyone has
discovered, the first thing you do before you can play a Minecraft game is start
your launcher.
